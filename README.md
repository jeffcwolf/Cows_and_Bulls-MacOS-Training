# Cows_and_Bulls-MacOS-Training

This is a macOS version of the game Cows and Bulls, often called Mastermind. Players must enter a string of four numbers into a text field in an attempt to guess a hidden number. If one of their digits is in the correct place it’s a “bull”, if it exists in the hidden number but is in the wrong place it’s a “cow”. The hidden number doesn’t contain any duplicate digits.
